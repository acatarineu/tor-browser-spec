<sect1 id="DesignRequirements">
  <title>Design Requirements and Philosophy</title>
  <para>

The Tor Browser Design Requirements are meant to describe the properties of a
Private Browsing Mode that defends against both network and local forensic
adversaries. 

  </para>
  <para>

There are two main categories of requirements: <link
linkend="security">Security Requirements</link>, and <link
linkend="privacy">Privacy Requirements</link>. Security Requirements are the
minimum properties in order for a browser to be able to support Tor and
similar privacy proxies safely. Privacy requirements are the set of properties
that cause us to prefer one browser over another. 

  </para>
  <para>

While we will endorse the use of browsers that meet the security requirements,
it is primarily the privacy requirements that cause us to maintain our own
browser distribution.

  </para>
  <para>

      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      <ulink url="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC 2119</ulink>.

  </para>

  <sect2 id="security">
   <title>Security Requirements</title>
   <para>

The security requirements are primarily concerned with ensuring the safe use
of Tor. Violations in these properties typically result in serious risk for
the user in terms of immediate deanonymization and/or observability. With
respect to browser support, security requirements are the minimum properties
in order for Tor to support the use of a particular browser.

   </para>

<orderedlist> 
 <listitem><link linkend="proxy-obedience"><command>Proxy
Obedience</command></link>
 <para>The browser
MUST NOT bypass Tor proxy settings for any content.</para></listitem>

 <listitem><link linkend="state-separation"><command>State
Separation</command></link>

 <para>

The browser MUST NOT provide the content window with any state from any other
browsers or any non-Tor browsing modes. This includes shared state from
independent plugins, and shared state from operating system implementations of
TLS and other support libraries.

</para></listitem>

 <listitem><link linkend="disk-avoidance"><command>Disk
Avoidance</command></link>

<para>

The browser MUST NOT write any information that is derived from or that
reveals browsing activity to the disk, or store it in memory beyond the
duration of one browsing session, unless the user has explicitly opted to
store their browsing history information to disk.

</para></listitem>
 <listitem><link linkend="app-data-isolation"><command>Application Data
Isolation</command></link>

<para>

The components involved in providing private browsing MUST be self-contained,
or MUST provide a mechanism for rapid, complete removal of all evidence of the
use of the mode. In other words, the browser MUST NOT write or cause the
operating system to write <emphasis>any information</emphasis> about the use
of private browsing to disk outside of the application's control. The user
must be able to ensure that secure deletion of the software is sufficient to
remove evidence of the use of the software. All exceptions and shortcomings
due to operating system behavior MUST be wiped by an uninstaller. However, due
to permissions issues with access to swap, implementations MAY choose to leave
it out of scope, and/or leave it to the operating system/platform to implement
ephemeral-keyed encrypted swap.

</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="privacy">
   <title>Privacy Requirements</title>
   <para>

The privacy requirements are primarily concerned with reducing linkability:
the ability for a user's activity on one site to be linked with their activity
on another site without their knowledge or explicit consent. With respect to
browser support, privacy requirements are the set of properties that cause us
to prefer one browser over another. 

   </para>

   <para>

For the purposes of the unlinkability requirements of this section as well as
the descriptions in the <link linkend="Implementation">implementation
section</link>, a <command>URL bar origin</command> means at least the
second-level DNS name.  For example, for mail.google.com, the origin would be
google.com. Implementations MAY, at their option, restrict the URL bar origin
to be the entire fully qualified domain name.

   </para>

<orderedlist> 
 <listitem><link linkend="identifier-linkability"><command>Cross-Origin
Identifier Unlinkability</command></link> 
  <para>

User activity on one URL bar origin MUST NOT be linkable to their activity in
any other URL bar origin by any third party automatically or without user
interaction or approval. This requirement specifically applies to linkability
from stored browser identifiers, authentication tokens, and shared state. The
requirement does not apply to linkable information the user manually submits
to sites, or due to information submitted during manual link traversal. This
functionality SHOULD NOT interfere with interactive, click-driven federated
login in a substantial way.

  </para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem><link linkend="fingerprinting-linkability"><command>Cross-Origin
Fingerprinting Unlinkability</command></link> 
  <para>

User activity on one URL bar origin MUST NOT be linkable to their activity in
any other URL bar origin by any third party. This property specifically applies to
linkability from fingerprinting browser behavior.

  </para>
 </listitem>
 <listitem><link linkend="new-identity"><command>Long-Term
Unlinkability</command></link>
  <para>

The browser MUST provide an obvious, easy way for the user to remove all of
its authentication tokens and browser state and obtain a fresh identity.
Additionally, the browser SHOULD clear linkable state by default automatically
upon browser restart, except at user option.

  </para>
 </listitem>
</orderedlist>

  </sect2>
  <sect2 id="philosophy">
  <title>Philosophy</title>
   <para>

In addition to the above design requirements, the technology decisions about
Tor Browser are also guided by some philosophical positions about technology.

   </para>
   <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>Preserve existing user model</command>
      <para>

The existing way that the user expects to use a browser must be preserved. If
the user has to maintain a different mental model of how the sites they are
using behave depending on tab, browser state, or anything else that would not
normally be what they experience in their default browser, the user will
inevitably be confused. They will make mistakes and reduce their privacy as a
result. Worse, they may just stop using the browser, assuming it is broken.

      </para>
      <para>

User model breakage was one of the <ulink
url="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/toggle-or-not-toggle-end-torbutton">failures
of Torbutton</ulink>: Even if users managed to install everything properly,
the toggle model was too hard for the average user to understand, especially
in the face of accumulating tabs from multiple states crossed with the current
Tor-state of the browser. 

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Favor the implementation mechanism least likely to
break sites</command>
      <para>

In general, we try to find solutions to privacy issues that will not induce
site breakage, though this is not always possible.

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Plugins must be restricted</command>
      <para>

Even if plugins always properly used the browser proxy settings (which none of
them do) and could not be induced to bypass them (which all of them can), the
activities of closed-source plugins are very difficult to audit and control.
They can obtain and transmit all manner of system information to websites,
often have their own identifier storage for tracking users, and also
contribute to fingerprinting.

      </para>
      <para>

Therefore, if plugins are to be enabled in private browsing modes, they must
be restricted from running automatically on every page (via click-to-play
placeholders), and/or be sandboxed to restrict the types of system calls they
can execute. If the user agent allows the user to craft an exemption to allow
a plugin to be used automatically, it must only apply to the top level URL bar
domain, and not to all sites, to reduce cross-origin fingerprinting
linkability.

       </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Minimize Global Privacy Options</command>
      <para>

<ulink url="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3100">Another
failure of Torbutton</ulink> was the options panel. Each option
that detectably alters browser behavior can be used as a fingerprinting tool.
Similarly, all extensions <ulink
url="http://blog.chromium.org/2010/06/extensions-in-incognito.html">should be
disabled in the mode</ulink> except as an opt-in basis. We should not load
system-wide and/or operating system provided addons or plugins.

     </para>
     <para>
Instead of global browser privacy options, privacy decisions should be made
<ulink
url="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Privacy/Features/Site-based_data_management_UI">per
URL bar origin</ulink> to eliminate the possibility of linkability
between domains. For example, when a plugin object (or a Javascript access of
window.plugins) is present in a page, the user should be given the choice of
allowing that plugin object for that URL bar origin only. The same
goes for exemptions to third party cookie policy, geolocation, and any other
privacy permissions.
     </para>
     <para>
If the user has indicated they wish to record local history storage, these
permissions can be written to disk. Otherwise, they should remain memory-only. 
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>No filters</command>
      <para>

Site-specific or filter-based addons such as <ulink
url="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/">AdBlock
Plus</ulink>, <ulink url="http://requestpolicy.com/">Request Policy</ulink>,
<ulink url="http://www.ghostery.com/about">Ghostery</ulink>, <ulink
url="http://priv3.icsi.berkeley.edu/">Priv3</ulink>, and <ulink
url="http://sharemenot.cs.washington.edu/">Sharemenot</ulink> are to be
avoided. We believe that these addons do not add any real privacy to a proper
<link linkend="Implementation">implementation</link> of the above <link
linkend="privacy">privacy requirements</link>, and that development efforts
should be focused on general solutions that prevent tracking by all
third parties, rather than a list of specific URLs or hosts.
     </para>
     <para>
Filter-based addons can also introduce strange breakage and cause usability
nightmares, and will also fail to do their job if an adversary simply
registers a new domain or creates a new URL path. Worse still, the unique
filter sets that each user creates or installs will provide a wealth of
fingerprinting targets.
      </para>
      <para>

As a general matter, we are also generally opposed to shipping an always-on Ad
blocker with Tor Browser. We feel that this would damage our credibility in
terms of demonstrating that we are providing privacy through a sound design
alone, as well as damage the acceptance of Tor users by sites that support
themselves through advertising revenue.

      </para>
      <para>
Users are free to install these addons if they wish, but doing
so is not recommended, as it will alter the browser request fingerprint.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Stay Current</command>
      <para>
We believe that if we do not stay current with the support of new web
technologies, we cannot hope to substantially influence or be involved in
their proper deployment or privacy realization. However, we will likely disable
high-risk features pending analysis, audit, and mitigation.
      </para>
     </listitem>
<!--
     <listitem><command>Transparency in Navigation Tracking</command>
      <para>

While we believe it is possible to restrict third party tracking with only
minimal site breakage, it is our long-term goal to further reduce cross-origin
click navigation tracking to mechanisms that are detectable by experts and
attentive users, so they can alert the general public if cross-origin
click navigation tracking is happening where it should not be.

      </para>
      <para>

However, the entrenched nature of certain archaic web features make it
impossible for us to achieve this wider goal by ourselves without substantial
site breakage. So, instead we maintain a <link linkend="deprecate">Deprecation
Wishlist</link> of archaic web technologies that are currently being (ab)used
to facilitate federated login and other legitimate click-driven cross-domain
activity but that can one day be replaced with more privacy friendly,
auditable alternatives.

   <title>Adversary Model</title>
   <para>

A Tor web browser adversary has a number of goals, capabilities, and attack
types that can be used to illustrate the design requirements for the
Tor Browser. Let's start with the goals.

   </para>
   <sect2 id="adversary-goals">
    <title>Adversary Goals</title>
    <orderedlist>
<!-- These aren't really commands.. But it's the closest I could find in an
acceptable style.. Don't really want to make my own stylesheet -->
     <listitem><command>Bypassing proxy settings</command>
     <para>The adversary's primary goal is direct compromise and bypass of 
Tor, causing the user to directly connect to an IP of the adversary's
choosing.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Correlation of Tor vs Non-Tor Activity</command>
     <para>If direct proxy bypass is not possible, the adversary will likely
happily settle for the ability to correlate something a user did via Tor with
their non-Tor activity. This can be done with cookies, cache identifiers,
Javascript events, and even CSS. Sometimes the fact that a user uses Tor may
be enough for some authorities.</para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>History disclosure</command>
     <para>
The adversary may also be interested in history disclosure: the ability to
query a user's history to see if they have issued certain censored search
queries, or visited censored sites.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Correlate activity across multiple sites</command>
     <para>

The primary goal of the advertising networks is to know that the user who
visited siteX.com is the same user that visited siteY.com to serve them
targeted ads. The advertising networks become our adversary insofar as they
attempt to perform this correlation without the user's explicit consent.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Fingerprinting/anonymity set reduction</command>
     <para>

Fingerprinting (more generally: "anonymity set reduction") is used to attempt
to gather identifying information on a particular individual without the use
of tracking identifiers. If the dissident or whistleblower's timezone is
available, and they are using a rare build of Firefox for an obscure operating
system, and they have a specific display resolution only used on one type of
laptop, this can be very useful information for tracking them down, or at
least <link linkend="fingerprinting">tracking their activities</link>.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>History records and other on-disk
information</command>
     <para>

In some cases, the adversary may opt for a heavy-handed approach, such as
seizing the computers of all Tor users in an area (especially after narrowing
the field by the above two pieces of information). History records and cache
data are the primary goals here. Secondary goals may include confirming
on-disk identifiers (such as hostname and disk-logged spoofed MAC address
history) obtained by other means.

     </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="adversary-positioning">
    <title>Adversary Capabilities - Positioning</title>
    <para>
The adversary can position themselves at a number of different locations in
order to execute their attacks.
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>Exit Node or Upstream Router</command>
     <para>
The adversary can run exit nodes, or alternatively, they may control routers
upstream of exit nodes. Both of these scenarios have been observed in the
wild.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Ad servers and/or Malicious Websites</command>
     <para>
The adversary can also run websites, or more likely, they can contract out
ad space from a number of different ad servers and inject content that way. For
some users, the adversary may be the ad servers themselves. It is not
inconceivable that ad servers may try to subvert or reduce a user's anonymity 
through Tor for marketing purposes.
     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Local Network/ISP/Upstream Router</command>
     <para>
The adversary can also inject malicious content at the user's upstream router
when they have Tor disabled, in an attempt to correlate their Tor and Non-Tor
activity.
     </para>
     <para>

Additionally, at this position the adversary can block Tor, or attempt to
recognize the traffic patterns of specific web pages at the entrance to the Tor
network. 

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Physical Access</command>
     <para>
Some users face adversaries with intermittent or constant physical access.
Users in Internet cafes, for example, face such a threat. In addition, in
countries where simply using tools like Tor is illegal, users may face
confiscation of their computer equipment for excessive Tor usage or just
general suspicion.
     </para>
     </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
   </sect2>

   <sect2 id="attacks">
    <title>Adversary Capabilities - Attacks</title>
    <para>

The adversary can perform the following attacks from a number of different 
positions to accomplish various aspects of their goals. It should be noted
that many of these attacks (especially those involving IP address leakage) are
often performed by accident by websites that simply have Javascript, dynamic 
CSS elements, and plugins. Others are performed by ad servers seeking to
correlate users' activity across different IP addresses, and still others are
performed by malicious agents on the Tor network and at national firewalls.

    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>Read and insert identifiers</command>
     <para>

The browser contains multiple facilities for storing identifiers that the
adversary creates for the purposes of tracking users. These identifiers are
most obviously cookies, but also include HTTP auth, DOM storage, cached
scripts and other elements with embedded identifiers, client certificates, and
even TLS Session IDs.

     </para>
     <para>

An adversary in a position to perform MITM content alteration can inject
document content elements to both read and inject cookies for arbitrary
domains. In fact, even many "SSL secured" websites are vulnerable to this sort of
<ulink url="http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2007/Aug/0070.html">active
sidejacking</ulink>. In addition, the ad networks of course perform tracking
with cookies as well.

     </para>
     <para>

These types of attacks are attempts at subverting our <link
linkend="identifier-linkability">Cross-Origin Identifier Unlinkability</link> and <link
linkend="new-identity">Long-Term Unlinkability</link> design requirements.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem id="fingerprinting"><command>Fingerprint users based on browser
attributes</command>
<para>

There is an absurd amount of information available to websites via attributes
of the browser. This information can be used to reduce anonymity set, or even
uniquely fingerprint individual users. Attacks of this nature are typically
aimed at tracking users across sites without their consent, in an attempt to
subvert our <link linkend="fingerprinting-linkability">Cross-Origin
Fingerprinting Unlinkability</link> and <link
linkend="new-identity">Long-Term Unlinkability</link> design requirements.

</para>

<para>

Fingerprinting is an intimidating
problem to attempt to tackle, especially without a metric to determine or at
least intuitively understand and estimate which features will most contribute
to linkability between visits.

</para>

<para>

The <ulink url="https://panopticlick.eff.org/about.php">Panopticlick study
done</ulink> by the EFF uses the <ulink
url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29">Shannon
entropy</ulink> - the number of identifying bits of information encoded in
browser properties - as this metric. Their <ulink
url="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Fingerprinting#Data">result data</ulink> is
definitely useful, and the metric is probably the appropriate one for
determining how identifying a particular browser property is. However, some
quirks of their study means that they do not extract as much information as
they could from display information: they only use desktop resolution and do
not attempt to infer the size of toolbars. In the other direction, they may be
over-counting in some areas, as they did not compute joint entropy over
multiple attributes that may exhibit a high degree of correlation. Also, new
browser features are added regularly, so the data should not be taken as
final.

      </para>
     <para>

Despite the uncertainty, all fingerprinting attacks leverage the following
attack vectors:

     </para>
     <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>Observing Request Behavior</command>
     <para>

Properties of the user's request behavior comprise the bulk of low-hanging
fingerprinting targets. These include: User agent, Accept-* headers, pipeline
usage, and request ordering. Additionally, the use of custom filters such as
AdBlock and other privacy filters can be used to fingerprint request patterns
(as an extreme example).

     </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem><command>Inserting Javascript</command>
     <para>

Javascript can reveal a lot of fingerprinting information. It provides DOM
objects such as window.screen and window.navigator to extract information
about the user agent. 

Also, Javascript can be used to query the user's timezone via the
<function>Date()</function> object, <ulink
url="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/#5.13">WebGL</ulink> can
reveal information about the video card in use, and high precision timing
information can be used to <ulink
url="http://w2spconf.com/2011/papers/jspriv.pdf">fingerprint the CPU and
interpreter speed</ulink>. In the future, new JavaScript features such as
<ulink url="http://w3c-test.org/webperf/specs/ResourceTiming/">Resource
Timing</ulink> may leak an unknown amount of network timing related
information.

     </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem><command>Inserting Plugins</command>
     <para>

The Panopticlick project found that the mere list of installed plugins (in
navigator.plugins) was sufficient to provide a large degree of
fingerprintability. Additionally, plugins are capable of extracting font lists,
interface addresses, and other machine information that is beyond what the
browser would normally provide to content. In addition, plugins can be used to
store unique identifiers that are more difficult to clear than standard
cookies.  <ulink url="http://epic.org/privacy/cookies/flash.html">Flash-based
cookies</ulink> fall into this category, but there are likely numerous other
examples. Beyond fingerprinting, plugins are also abysmal at obeying the proxy
settings of the browser.

     <para>

Website traffic fingerprinting is an attempt by the adversary to recognize the
encrypted traffic patterns of specific websites. In the case of Tor, this
attack would take place between the user and the Guard node, or at the Guard
node itself.
     </para> 

	 <para> The most comprehensive study of the statistical properties of this
attack against Tor was done by <ulink
url="http://lorre.uni.lu/~andriy/papers/acmccs-wpes11-fingerprinting.pdf">Panchenko
et al</ulink>. Unfortunately, the publication bias in academia has encouraged
the production of a number of follow-on attack papers claiming "improved"
success rates, in some cases even claiming to completely invalidate any
attempt at defense. These "improvements" are actually enabled primarily by
taking a number of shortcuts (such as classifying only very small numbers of
web pages, neglecting to publish ROC curves or at least false positive rates,
and/or omitting the effects of dataset size on their results). Despite these
subsequent "improvements", we are skeptical of the efficacy of this attack in
a real world scenario, <emphasis>especially</emphasis> in the face of any
defenses.

     </para>
     <para>

In general, with machine learning, as you increase the <ulink
url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC_dimension">number and/or complexity of
categories to classify</ulink> while maintaining a limit on reliable feature
information you can extract, you eventually run out of descriptive feature
information, and either true positive accuracy goes down or the false positive
rate goes up. This error is called the <ulink
url="http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/csep573/98sp/lectures/lecture8/sld050.htm">bias
in your hypothesis space</ulink>. In fact, even for unbiased hypothesis
spaces, the number of training examples required to achieve a reasonable error
bound is <ulink
url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning#Equivalence">a
function of the complexity of the categories</ulink> you need to classify.

     </para>
      <para>


In the case of this attack, the key factors that increase the classification
complexity (and thus hinder a real world adversary who attempts this attack)
are large numbers of dynamically generated pages, partially cached content,
and also the non-web activity of entire Tor network. This yields an effective
number of "web pages" many orders of magnitude larger than even <ulink
url="http://lorre.uni.lu/~andriy/papers/acmccs-wpes11-fingerprinting.pdf">Panchenko's
"Open World" scenario</ulink>, which suffered continuous near-constant decline
in the true positive rate as the "Open World" size grew (see figure 4). This
large level of classification complexity is further confounded by a noisy and
low resolution featureset - one which is also relatively easy for the defender
to manipulate at low cost.

     </para>
     <para>

To make matters worse for a real-world adversary, the ocean of Tor Internet
activity (at least, when compared to a lab setting) makes it a certainty that
an adversary attempting examine large amounts of Tor traffic will ultimately
be overwhelmed by false positives (even after making heavy tradeoffs on the
ROC curve to minimize false positives to below 0.01%). This problem is known
in the IDS literature as the <ulink
url="http://www.raid-symposium.org/raid99/PAPERS/Axelsson.pdf">Base Rate
Fallacy</ulink>, and it is the primary reason that anomaly and activity
classification-based IDS and antivirus systems have failed to materialize in
the marketplace (despite early success in academic literature).

     </para>
     <para>

Still, we do not believe that these issues are enough to dismiss the attack
outright. But we do believe these factors make it both worthwhile and
effective to <link linkend="traffic-fingerprinting-defenses">deploy
light-weight defenses</link> that reduce the accuracy of this attack by
further contributing noise to hinder successful feature extraction.

  <sect2 id="identifier-linkability">
   <title>Cross-Origin Identifier Unlinkability</title>
   <para>

The Cross-Origin Identifier Unlinkability design requirement is satisfied
through first party isolation of all browser identifier sources. First party
isolation means that all identifier sources and browser state are scoped
(isolated) using the URL bar domain. This scoping is performed in
combination with any additional third party scope. When first party isolation
is used with explicit identifier storage that already has a constrained third
party scope (such as cookies, DOM storage, and cache), this approach is
referred to as "double-keying".

   </para>
   <para>

The benefit of this approach comes not only in the form of reduced
linkability, but also in terms of simplified privacy UI. If all stored browser
state and permissions become associated with the URL bar origin, the six or
seven different pieces of privacy UI governing these identifiers and
permissions can become just one piece of UI. For instance, a window that lists
the URL bar origin for which browser state exists, possibly with a
context-menu option to drill down into specific types of state or permissions.
An example of this simplification can be seen in Figure 1.

This example UI is a mock-up of how isolating identifiers to the URL bar
origin can simplify the privacy UI for all data - not just cookies. Once
browser identifiers and site permissions operate on a URL bar basis, the same
privacy window can represent browsing history, DOM Storage, HTTP Auth, search
form history, login values, and so on within a context menu for each site.

Unfortunately, many aspects of browser state can serve as identifier storage,
and no other browser vendor or standards body has invested the effort to

doubleclick.net URL that finally redirects to a cnn.com URL, only cookies from
cnn.com should be retained after the redirect chain completes.

   <title>Cross-Origin Fingerprinting Unlinkability</title>

   <para>

Browser fingerprinting is the act of inspecting browser behaviors and features in
an attempt to differentiate and track individual users. Fingerprinting attacks
are typically broken up into passive and active vectors. Passive
fingerprinting makes use of any information the browser provides automatically
to a website without any specific action on the part of the website. Active
fingerprinting makes use of any information that can be extracted from the
browser by some specific website action, usually involving Javascript.
Some definitions of browser fingerprinting also include supercookies and
cookie-like identifier storage, but we deal with those issues separately in
the <link linkend="identifier-linkability">preceding section on identifier
linkability</link>.

   </para>
    <para>

For the most part, however, we do not differentiate between passive or active
fingerprinting sources, since many active fingerprinting mechanisms are very
rapid, and can be obfuscated or disguised as legitimate functionality.
Instead, we believe fingerprinting can only be rationally addressed if we
understand where the problem comes from, what sources of issues are the most
severe, and how to study the efficacy of defenses properly.

    </para>

   <sect3 id="fingerprinting-scope">
    <title>Sources of Fingerprinting Issues</title>
    <para>

All browser fingerprinting issues arise from one of four primary sources:
end-user configuration details, device and hardware characteristics, operating
system vendor and version differences, and browser vendor and version
differences. Additionally, user behavior itself provides one more source of
potential fingerprinting.

    </para>
    <para>

In order to help prioritize and inform defenses, we now list these sources in
order from most severe to least severe in terms of the amount of information
they reveal, and describe them in more detail.

    </para>
    <orderedlist>
     <listitem><command>End-user Configuration Details</command>
      <para>

End-user configuration details are by far the most severe threat to
fingerprinting, as they will quickly provide enough information to uniquely
identify a user. We believe it is essential to avoid exposing platform
configuration details to website content at all costs. We also discourage
excessive fine-grained customization of Tor Browser by minimizing and
aggregating user-facing privacy and security options, as well as by
discouraging the use of additional addons. When it is necessary to expose
configuration details in the course of providing functionality, we strive to
do so only on a per-site basis via site permissions, to avoid linkability.

     </para>
    </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Device and Hardware Characteristics</command>
      <para>

Device and hardware characteristics can be determined in three ways: they can
be reported explicitly by the browser, they can be inferred through browser
functionality, or they can be extracted through statistical measurements of
system performance. We are most concerned with the cases where this
information is either directly reported or can be determined via a single use
of an API or feature, and prefer to place such APIs either behind site
permissions, alter their functionality to prevent exposing the most variable
aspects of these characteristics, or disable them entirely.

      </para>
      <para>

On the other hand, because statistical inference of system performance
requires many iterations to achieve accuracy in the face of noise and
concurrent activity, we are less concerned with this mechanism of extracting
this information. We also expect that reducing the resolution of Javascript's
time sources will significantly increase the duration of execution required to
extract accurate results, and thus make statistical approaches both
unattractive and highly noticeable due to excessive resource consumption.

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Operating System Vendor and Version Differences</command>
      <para>

Operating system vendor and version differences permeate many different
aspects of the browser. While it is possible to address these issues with some
effort, the relative lack of diversity in operating systems causes us to
primarily focus our efforts on passive operating system fingerprinting
mechanisms at this point in time. For the purposes of protecting user
anonymity, it is not strictly essential that the operating system be
completely concealed, though we recognize that it is useful to reduce this
differentiation ability where possible, especially for cases where the
specific version of a system can be inferred.

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>User Behavior</command>
      <para>

While somewhat outside the scope of browser fingerprinting, for completeness
it is important to mention that users themselves theoretically might be
fingerprinted through their behavior while interacting with a website. This
behavior includes e.g. keystrokes, mouse movements, click speed, and writing
style. Basic vectors such as keystroke and mouse usage fingerprinting can be
mitigated by altering Javascript's notion of time. More advanced issues like
writing style fingerprinting are the domain of <ulink
url="https://github.com/psal/anonymouth">other tools</ulink>.

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Browser Vendor and Version Differences</command>
      <para>

Due to vast differences in feature set and implementation behavior even
between different versions of the same browser, browser vendor and version
differences are simply not possible to conceal in any realistic way. It
is only possible to minimize the differences among different installations of
the same browser vendor and version. We make no effort to mimic any other
major browser vendor, and in fact most of our fingerprinting defenses serve to
differentiate Tor Browser users from normal Firefox users. Because of this,
any study that lumps browser vendor and version differences in to its analysis
of the fingerprintability of a population is largely useless for evaluating
either attacks or defenses. Unfortunately, this includes popular large-scale
studies such as <ulink

    <title>General Fingerprinting Defenses</title>
    <para>

When implemented after an API or feature has been standardized and widely
deployed, defenses to fingerprinting issues tend to take one of the following
forms: value spoofing, subsystem reimplementation, virtualization, site
permissions, and feature removal. 

    </para>
  <orderedlist>
   <listitem><command>Value Spoofing</command>
     <para>

Value spoofing can be used for simple cases where the browser directly provides some
aspect of the user's configuration details, devices, hardware, or operating
system directly to a website. It becomes less useful when the fingerprinting
method is instead relying on API behavior.

     </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem><command>Subsystem Reimplementation</command>
   <para>

In cases where simple spoofing is not enough to properly conceal underlying
device characteristics or operating system details, the underlying
subsystem that provides the functionality for a feature or API may need
to be completely reimplemented. This is most common in cases where
customizable or version-specific aspects of the user's operating system are
visible through the browser's featureset or APIs, usually because the browser
directly exposes OS-provided implementations of underlying features. In these
cases, such OS-provided implementations must be replaced by a generic
implementation, or at least an implementation wrapper that makes effort to
conceal any user-customized aspects of the system.

   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><command>Virtualization</command>
   <para>

Virtualization is needed when simply reimplementing a feature in a different
way is insufficient to fully conceal the underlying behavior. This is most
common in instances of device and hardware fingerprinting, but since the
notion of time can also be virtualized, it also can apply to any instance
where an accurate measure of wall clock time is required for a fingerprinting
vector to attain high accuracy.

   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><command>Site Permissions</command>
   <para>

In the event that virtualization is too expensive in terms of performance or
engineering effort, and the relative expected usage of a feature is rare, site
permissions can be used to prevent the usage of a feature except in cases
where the user actually wishes to use it. Unfortunately, this mechanism
becomes less effective once a feature becomes widely overused and abused by
many websites, as warning fatigue quickly sets in for most users.

   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><command>Feature/Functionality Removal</command>
   <para>

When extremely invasive features serve only a narrow domain or use case, or
there are alternate ways of accomplishing the same task, features and/or
certain aspects of their functionality may be simply removed.

  <sect3>
   <title>Randomization or Uniformity?</title>
    <para>

When applying a form of defense to a specific fingerprinting vector or source, 
there are two general strategies available. Either the implementation for all
users of a single browser implementation can be made to behave as uniformly as
possible, or the user agent can attempt to randomize its behavior, so that
each interaction between a user and a site provides a different fingerprint.

    </para>
    <para>

Although <ulink url="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/209989/tr1.pdf">some
research suggests</ulink> that randomization can be effective, so far striving
for uniformity has generally proved to be a better strategy for Tor Browser
for the following reasons:

    </para>

   <orderedlist>
    <listitem><command>Randomization is not a shortcut</command>
     <para>

While it appears that many end-user configuration details that the browser
currently exposes may be safely replaced by false information, randomization
of these details must be just as exhaustive as an approach that seeks to make
these behaviors uniform. In the face of either strategy, the adversary can
still make use of those features which have not been altered to be either
sufficiently uniform or sufficiently random.

     </para>
     <para>

Furthermore, the randomization approach seems to break down when it is applied
to deeper issues where underlying system functionality is directly exposed. In
particular, it is not clear how to randomize the capabilities of hardware
attached to a computer in such a way that it either convincingly behaves like
other hardware, or where the exact properties of the hardware that vary from
user to user are sufficiently randomized. Similarly, truly concealing operating
system version differences through randomization may require reimplementation
of the underlying operating system functionality to ensure that every version
that your randomization is trying to blend in with is covered by the range of
possible behaviors.

     </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Evaluation and measurement difficulties</command>
      <para>

The fact that randomization causes behaviors to differ slightly with every
visit makes it appealing at first glance, but this same property makes it very
difficult to objectively measure its effectiveness. By contrast, an
implementation that strives for uniformity is very simple to measure. Despite
their current flaws, a properly designed version of <ulink
url="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">Panopticlick</ulink> or <ulink
url="https://amiunique.org/">Am I Unique</ulink> could report the entropy and
uniqueness rates for all users of a single user agent version, without the
need for complicated statistics about the variance of the measured behaviors.

      </para>
      <para>

Randomization (especially incomplete randomization) may also provide a false
sense of security. When a fingerprinting attempt makes naive use of randomized
information, a fingerprint will appear unstable, but may not actually be
sufficiently randomized to prevent a dedicated adversary.  Sophisticated
fingerprinting mechanisms may either ignore randomized information, or
incorporate knowledge of the distribution and range of randomized values into
the creation of a more stable fingerprint (by either removing the randomness,
modeling it, or averaging it).

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Usability issues</command>
      <para>

When randomization is introduced to features that affect site behavior, it can
be very distracting for this behavior to change between visits of a given
site. For simple cases such as when this information affects layout behavior, 
this will lead to visual nuisances. However, when this information affects
reported functionality or hardware characteristics, sometimes a site will
function one way on one visit, and another way on a subsequent visit.

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Performance costs</command>

      <para>

Randomizing involves performance costs. This is especially true if the
fingerprinting surface is large (like in a modern browser) and one needs more
elaborate randomizing strategies (including randomized virtualization) to
ensure that the randomization fully conceals the true behavior. Many calls to
a cryptographically secure random number generator during the course of a page
load will both serve to exhaust available entropy pools, as well as lead to
increased computation while loading a page.

      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem><command>Increased vulnerability surface</command>

Randomizing itself might introduce a new fingerprinting vector as the process
of generating the values for the fingerprintable attributes could be itself
susceptible to side-channel attacks, analysis, or exploitation.

third party software), as well as their internal functionality.

     </para>
     <para><command>Design Goal:</command>

All plugins that have not been specifically audited or sandboxed MUST be
disabled. To reduce linkability potential, even sandboxed plugins should not
be allowed to load objects until the user has clicked through a click-to-play
barrier.  Additionally, version information should be reduced or obfuscated
until the plugin object is loaded. For flash, we wish to <ulink
url="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3974">provide a
settings.sol file</ulink> to disable Flash cookies, and to restrict P2P
features that are likely to bypass proxy settings. We'd also like to restrict
access to fonts and other system information (such as IP address and MAC
address) in such a sandbox.

     </para>
     <para><command>Implementation Status:</command>

Currently, we entirely disable all plugins in Tor Browser. However, as a
compromise due to the popularity of Flash, we allow users to re-enable Flash,
and flash objects are blocked behind a click-to-play barrier that is available
only after the user has specifically enabled plugins. Flash is the only plugin
available, the rest are entirely
blocked from loading by the Firefox patches mentioned in the <link

leaking plugin installation information.

     <para>

After plugins and plugin-provided information, we believe that the <ulink
url="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas">HTML5
Canvas</ulink> is the single largest fingerprinting threat browsers face
today. <ulink
url="http://www.w2spconf.com/2012/papers/w2sp12-final4.pdf">Initial
studies</ulink> show that the Canvas can provide an easy-access fingerprinting
target: The adversary simply renders WebGL, font, and named color data to a
Canvas element, extracts the image buffer, and computes a hash of that image
data. Subtle differences in the video card, font packs, and even font and
graphics library versions allow the adversary to produce a stable, simple,
high-entropy fingerprint of a computer. In fact, the hash of the rendered
image can be used almost identically to a tracking cookie by the web server.

     </para>
     <para>

In some sense, the canvas can be seen as the union of many other
fingerprinting vectors. If WebGL is normalized through software rendering,
system colors were standardized, and the browser shipped a fixed collection of
fonts (see later points in this list), it might not be necessary to create a
canvas permission. However, until then, to reduce the threat from this vector,
we have patched Firefox to <ulink url="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor-browser.git/commit/?h=tor-browser-31.6.0esr-4.5-1&amp;id=6a169ef0166b268b1a27546a17b3d7470330917d">prompt before returning valid image data</ulink> to the Canvas APIs,

the list of TCP ports open on 127.0.0.1</ulink>, as well as on any other
machines on the local network. In other browsers, this can be accomplished by
DOM events on image or script tags. This open vs filtered vs closed port list
can provide a very unique fingerprint of a machine, because it essentially
enables the detection of many different popular third party applications and
optional system services (Skype, Bitcoin, Bittorrent and other P2P software,
SSH ports, SMB and related LAN services, CUPS and printer daemon config ports,
mail servers, and so on). It is also possible to determine when ports are
closed versus filtered/blocked (and thus probe custom firewall configuration).

In Tor Browser, we prevent access to 127.0.0.1/localhost by ensuring that even
these requests are still sent by Firefox to our SOCKS proxy (ie we set

Tor client then rejects them, since it is configured to proxy for internal IP
addresses by default. Access to the local network is forbidden via the same

aren't an attractive vector for this reason. However, because it is not clear
if certain carefully-crafted error conditions in these protocols could cause
them to reveal machine information and still fail silently prior to the

still be available, especially given that additional fonts often end up
installed by third party software and for multilingual support.

versions of many South Asian languages. When combined in a way that chooses the
smallest font implementations for each locale, these three font sets provide
coverage for the all languages used on Wikipedia with more than
10,000 articles, and several others as well, in approximately 3MB of compressed
overhead. The <ulink url="https://www.google.com/get/noto/">Noto font

aspects of desktop widget positioning and size are user configurable, these
properties yield customized information about the computer, even beyond the

Our design goal here is to reduce the resolution information down to the bare
minimum required for properly rendering inside a content window. We intend to
report all rendering information correctly with respect to the size and
properties of the content window, but report an effective size of 0 for all
border material, and also report that the desktop is only as big as the inner
content window. Additionally, new browser windows are sized such that their
content windows are one of a few fixed sizes based on the user's desktop
resolution. In addition, to further reduce resolution-based fingerprinting, we
are <ulink

zoom/viewport-based mechanisms</ulink> that might allow us to always report the
same desktop resolution regardless of the actual size of the content window,

Because of the large amount of potential fingerprinting vectors and the <ulink

vulnerability surface</ulink>, we deploy a similar strategy against WebGL as
for plugins. First, WebGL Canvases have click-to-play placeholders (provided
by NoScript), and do not run until authorized by the user. Second, we
obfuscate driver information by setting the Firefox preferences
<command>webgl.disable-extensions</command> and
<command>webgl.min_capability_mode</command>, which reduce the information
provided by the following WebGL API calls: <command>getParameter()</command>,
<command>getSupportedExtensions()</command>, and

All Tor Browser users MUST report the same timezone to websites. Currently, we
choose UTC for this purpose, although an equally valid argument could be made
for EDT/EST due to the large English-speaking population density (coupled with
the fact that we spoof a US English user agent).  Additionally, the Tor
software should detect if the users clock is significantly divergent from the
clocks of the relays that it connects to, and use this to reset the clock
values used in Tor Browser to something reasonably accurate. Alternatively,
the browser can obtain this clock skew via a mechanism similar to that used in

     <para><command>Design Goal:</command>

We have <ulink
url="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3059">several potential
mitigation approaches</ulink> to reduce the accuracy of performance
fingerprinting without risking too much damage to functionality. Our current
favorite is to reduce the resolution of the Event.timeStamp and the Javascript
Date() object, while also introducing jitter. We believe that Javascript time
resolution may be reduced all the way up to the second before it seriously
impacts site operation. Our goal with this quantization is to increase the
amount of time it takes to mount a successful attack. <ulink
url="http://w2spconf.com/2011/papers/jspriv.pdf">Mowery et al</ulink> found
that even with the default precision in most browsers, they required up to 120
seconds of amortization and repeated trials to get stable results from their
feature set. We intend to work with the research community to establish the
optimum trade-off between quantization+jitter and amortization time, as well
as identify highly variable Javascript operations. As long as these attacks
take several seconds or more to execute, they are unlikely to be appealing to
advertisers, and are also very likely to be noticed if deployed against a
large number of people.

     <para>

As we mentioned in the introduction of this section, OS type fingerprinting is
currently considered a lower priority, due simply to the numerous ways that
characteristics of the operating system type may leak into content, and the
comparatively low contribution of OS to overall entropy. In particular, there
are likely to be many ways to measure the differences in widget size,
scrollbar size, and other rendered details on a page. Also, directly exported
OS routines (such as those from the standard C math library) expose
differences in their implementations through their return values.

     <para><command>Design Goal:</command>

We intend to reduce or eliminate OS type fingerprinting to the best extent
possible, but recognize that the effort for reward on this item is not as high
as other areas. The entropy on the current OS distribution is somewhere around
2 bits, which is much lower than other vectors which can also be used to
fingerprint configuration and user-specific information.  You can see the

Many sites do not support it, and even sites that advertise support for

developed SPDY as opposed to simply extending HTTP to improve pipelining. It

stages of the build process. Because Gitian creates an Ubuntu build
environment, we must use cross-compilation to create packages for Windows and
Mac OS. For Windows, we use mingw-w64 as our cross compiler. For Mac OS, we
use crosstools-ng in combination with a binary redistribution of the Mac OS 10.6
SDK.

   </para>

   <para>

The use of the Gitian system eliminates build non-determinism by normalizing
the build environment's hostname, username, build path, uname output,
toolchain versions, and time. On top of what Gitian provides, we also had to
address the following additional sources of non-determinism:

   </para>

   <orderedlist>
   <listitem><command>Filesystem and archive reordering</command>
    <para>

The most prevalent source of non-determinism in the components of Tor Browser
by far was various ways that archives (such as zip, tar, jar/ja, DMG, and
Firefox manifest lists) could be reordered. Many file archivers walk the
file system in inode structure order by default, which will result in ordering
differences between two different archive invocations, especially on machines
of different disk and hardware configurations.

    </para>
    <para>

The fix for this is to perform an additional sorting step on the input list
for archives, but care must be taken to instruct libc and other sorting routines
to use a fixed locale to determine lexicographic ordering, or machines with
different locale settings will produce different sort results. We chose the
'C' locale for this purpose. We created wrapper scripts for <ulink
url="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/tree/gitian/build-helpers/dtar.sh">tar</ulink>,
<ulink
url="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/tree/gitian/build-helpers/dzip.sh">zip</ulink>,
and <ulink

to aid in reproducible archive creation.

    </para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem><command>Uninitialized memory in toolchain/archivers</command>
    <para>

We ran into difficulties with both binutils and the DMG archive script using
uninitialized memory in certain data structures that ended up written to disk.
Our binutils fixes were merged upstream, but the DMG archive fix remains an
<ulink

patch</ulink>.

    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem><command>Fine-grained timestamps and timezone leaks</command>
    <para>

The standard way of controlling timestamps in Gitian is to use libfaketime,
which hooks time-related library calls to provide a fixed timestamp. However,
due to our use of wine to run py2exe for python-based pluggable transports,
pyc timestamps had to be addressed with an additional <ulink
url="https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-bundle.git/tree/gitian/build-helpers/pyc-timestamp.sh">helper
script</ulink>. The timezone leaks were addressed by setting the
<command>TZ</command> environment variable to UTC in our descriptors.

    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem><command>Deliberately generated entropy</command>
    <para>

In two circumstances, deliberately generated entropy was introduced in various
components of the build process. First, the BuildID Debuginfo identifier
(which associates detached debug files with their corresponding stripped
executables) was introducing entropy from some unknown source. We removed this
header using objcopy invocations in our build scriptlets, and opted to use GNU
DebugLink instead of BuildID for this association.

    </para>
    <para>

Second, on Linux, Firefox builds detached signatures of its cryptographic
libraries using a temporary key for FIPS-140 certification. A rather insane
subsection of the FIPS-140 certification standard requires that you distribute
signatures for all of your cryptographic libraries. The Firefox build process
meets this requirement by generating a temporary key, using it to sign the
libraries, and discarding the private portion of that key. Because there are
many other ways to intercept the crypto outside of modifying the actual DLL
images, we opted to simply remove these signature files from distribution.
There simply is no way to verify code integrity on a running system without
both OS and co-processor assistance. Download package signatures make sense of
course, but we handle those another way (as mentioned above).


    </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><command>LXC-specific leaks</command>
   <para>

Gitian provides an option to use LXC containers instead of full qemu-kvm
virtualization. Unfortunately, these containers can allow additional details
about the host OS to leak. In particular, umask settings as well as the
hostname and Linux kernel version can leak from the host OS into the LXC
container. We addressed umask by setting it explicitly in our Gitian
descriptor scriptlet, and addressed the hostname and kernel version leaks by
directly patching the aspects of the Firefox build process that included this
information into the build. It also turns out that some libraries (in
particular: libgmp) attempt to detect the current CPU to determine which
optimizations to compile in. This CPU type is uniform on our KVM instances,
but differs under LXC. We are also investigating currently
<ulink url="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12240">oddities related to
time-based dependency tracking</ulink> that only appear in LXC containers.

  <sect2>
    <title>Package Signatures and Verification</title>
    <para>

The build process generates a single sha256sums.txt file that contains a sorted
list of the SHA-256 hashes of every package produced for that build version. Each
official builder uploads this file and a GPG signature of it to a directory
on a Tor Project's web server. The build scripts have an optional matching
step that downloads these signatures, verifies them, and ensures that the
local builds match this file.

    </para>
    <para>

When builds are published officially, the single sha256sums.txt file is
accompanied by a detached GPG signature from each official builder that
produced a matching build. The packages are additionally signed with detached
GPG signatures from an official signing key.

    </para>
     <para>

The fact that the entire set of packages for a given version can be
authenticated by a single hash of the sha256sums.txt file will also allow us
to create a number of auxiliary authentication mechanisms for our packages,
beyond just trusting a single offline build machine and a single cryptographic
key's integrity. Interesting examples include providing multiple independent
cryptographic signatures for packages, listing the package hashes in the Tor
consensus, and encoding the package hashes in the Bitcoin blockchain.

     </para>
    <para>

The Windows releases are also signed by a hardware token provided by Digicert.
In order to verify package integrity, the signature must be stripped off using
the osslsigncode tool, as described on the <ulink
url="https://www.torproject.org/docs/verifying-signatures.html.en#BuildVerification">Signature
Verification</ulink> page.

    </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
    <title>Anonymous Verification</title>
    <para>

Due to the fact that bit-identical packages can be produced by anyone, the
security of this build system extends beyond the security of the official
build machines. In fact, it is still possible for build integrity to be
achieved even if all official build machines are compromised.

    </para>
    <para>

By default, all tor-specific dependencies and inputs to the build process are
downloaded over Tor, which allows build verifiers to remain anonymous and
hidden. Because of this, any individual can use our anonymity network to
privately download our source code, verify it against public signed, audited,
and mirrored git repositories, and reproduce our builds exactly, without being
subject to targeted attacks. If they notice any differences, they can alert
the public builders/signers, hopefully using a pseudonym or our anonymous
bug tracker account, to avoid revealing the fact that they are a build
verifier.

We make use of the Firefox updater in order to provide automatic updates to
users. We make use of certificate pinning to ensure that update checks cannot
be tampered with, and we sign the individual MAR update files with an offline
signing key.

   </para>
   <para>

The Firefox updater also has code to ensure that it can reliably access the
update server to prevent availability attacks, and complains to the user after 48
hours go by without a successful response from the server. Additionally, we
use Tor's SOCKS username and password isolation to ensure that every new
request to the updater (provided the former got issued more than 10 minutes ago)
traverses a separate circuit, to avoid holdback attacks by exit nodes.

Torbutton is a complicated piece of software. During development, changes to
one component can affect a whole slough of unrelated features.  A number of
aggregated test suites exist that can be used to test for regressions in
Torbutton and to help aid in the development of Torbutton-like addons and
other privacy modifications of other browsers. Some of these test suites exist
as a single automated page, while others are a series of pages you must visit
individually. They are provided here for reference and future regression
testing, and also in the hope that some brave soul will one day decide to
combine them into a comprehensive automated test suite.

<appendix id="Transparency">
<title>Towards Transparency in Navigation Tracking</title>
<para>

The <link linkend="privacy">privacy properties</link> of Tor Browser are based
upon the assumption that link-click navigation indicates user consent to
tracking between the linking site and the destination site.  While this
definition is sufficient to allow us to eliminate cross-site third party
tracking with only minimal site breakage, it is our long-term goal to further
reduce cross-origin click navigation tracking to mechanisms that are
detectable by attentive users, so they can alert the general public if
cross-origin click navigation tracking is happening where it should not be.

</para>
<para>

In an ideal world, the mechanisms of tracking that can be employed during a
link click would be limited to the contents of URL parameters and other
properties that are fully visible to the user before they click. However, the
entrenched nature of certain archaic web features make it impossible for us to
achieve this transparency goal by ourselves without substantial site breakage.
So, instead we maintain a <link linkend="deprecate">Deprecation
Wishlist</link> of archaic web technologies that are currently being (ab)used
to facilitate federated login and other legitimate click-driven cross-domain
activity but that can one day be replaced with more privacy friendly,
auditable alternatives.

</para>
<para>

Because the total elimination of side channels during cross-origin navigation
will undoubtedly break federated login as well as destroy ad revenue, we
also describe auditable alternatives and promising web draft standards that would
preserve this functionality while still providing transparency when tracking is
occurring. 

</para>

<sect1 id="deprecate">
 <title>Deprecation Wishlist</title>
 <orderedlist>
  <listitem><command>The Referer Header</command>
  <para>

We haven't disabled or restricted the Referer ourselves because of the
non-trivial number of sites that rely on the Referer header to "authenticate"
image requests and deep-link navigation on their sites. Furthermore, there
seems to be no real privacy benefit to taking this action by itself in a
vacuum, because many sites have begun encoding Referer URL information into
GET parameters when they need it to cross HTTP to HTTPS scheme transitions.
Google's +1 buttons are the best example of this activity.

  </para>
  <para>

Because of the availability of these other explicit vectors, we believe the
main risk of the Referer header is through inadvertent and/or covert data
leakage.  In fact, <ulink
url="http://www2.research.att.com/~bala/papers/wosn09.pdf">a great deal of
personal data</ulink> is inadvertently leaked to third parties through the
source URL parameters. 

  </para>
  <para>

We believe the Referer header should be made explicit, and believe that CSP
2.0 provides a <ulink
url="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP11/#directive-referrer">decent step in this
direction</ulink>. If a site wishes to transmit its URL to third party content
elements during load or during link-click, it should have to specify this as a
property of the associated HTML tag or CSP policy. With an explicit property
or policy, it would then be possible for the user agent to inform the user if
they are about to click on a link that will transmit Referer information
(perhaps through something as subtle as a different color in the lower toolbar
for the destination URL). This same UI notification can also be used for links
with the <ulink

<ulink url="http://www.thomasfrank.se/sessionvars.html">identifier
storage</ulink> during click navigation. This is sometimes used for additional
XSRF protection and federated login.
   </para>
   <para>

It's our opinion that the contents of window.name should not be preserved for
cross-origin navigation, but doing so may break federated login for some sites.

   </para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem><command>Javascript link rewriting</command>
   <para>

In general, it should not be possible for onclick handlers to alter the
navigation destination of 'a' tags, silently transform them into POST
requests, or otherwise create situations where a user believes they are
clicking on a link leading to one URL that ends up on another. This
functionality is deceptive and is frequently a vector for malware and phishing
attacks. Unfortunately, many legitimate sites also employ such transparent
link rewriting, and blanket disabling this functionality ourselves will simply
cause Tor Browser to fail to navigate properly on these sites.

   </para>
   <para>

Automated cross-origin redirects are one form of this behavior that is
possible for us to <ulink
