+ Cleanups
  + We specify browser.cache.memory.enable under disk avoidance. That's
    wrong. We don't even set it at all. Torbutton relic?
  + Disk leak documentation
  + Firefox 17 will mess up all patch links
 
- Heavy Writing by section
  + Intro:
    + We target Firefox ESR
    + Component description
  + Deprecation List/Future Philosophy:
    + Linkability Transparency from
      https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5273#comment:12
  + Adversary Goals
    + Describe how each adversary attack violates design goals
    + "Correlate activity across multiple site visits" as one of the adversary
      goals. This is the primary goal of the ad networks, though. We need to
      explicitly mention it in the Adversary Goals section for completeness.
  - Misc implementation
    + Link to prefs.js and describe omni.ja and extension-overrides hacks
    - document the environment variables and settings used to provide a non-grey "New Identity" button.
    - Mockup privacy UI
  - Identifier Linkability
    - Image cache jail
    - DOM storage jail
    - 3.5.8 is not clear that what we're trying to limit is non-click
      driven/non-interactive linkability rather than linkability in all cases.
      Other sections may have this problem, too.
      - This is a subtlety that arises from both the impossibility of satisfying
        unlinkability due to covert channels in GET/POST, as well as the desire
        to avoid breaking thinks like consensual federated login.
    - He reminded me about documenting disabling IndexedDB, but that is just one
      of the many prefs.js changes we need to document.
    - We should only preserve window.name if the url bar domain remains the
      same. I could be convinced of this, but it's going to be trickier to
      implement and I think it's not really possible to remove linkability for user
      clicks in general.
  - Fingerprinting
    - @font-face exemption and preference
    - Canvas prompt
    - Click-to-play WebGL
    - describe our resolution defenses
    - Explain why panopticlick is weirdsauce
    - provide an entropy count estimate for fingerprinting defenses
    - We should perhaps be more vocal about the fingerprinting issues with
      some or all of  http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/. I think I agree.
    - We report our useragent as 17.0
  - Testing
    - Sync with QA pages
    - Many are out of date
    - http://www.stayinvisible.com/
    - Evercookie test page, and perhaps also
      http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.de/2007/04/tracking-users-without-cookies.html

- Misc changes:
  + Plugin handling
    + All-but-flash patch
    + Plugin manager manipulation
    + We use Firefox's click-to-play
  - Addons
    - PDF.js inclusion
  - Torbutton does not update
  - Torbutton Security Settings
  - Update notification/version checking
  - Socks ports
  - Create a deprecation list and link to it:
    - Referer Header
    - Window.name
