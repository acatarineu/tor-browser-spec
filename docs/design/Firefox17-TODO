- Cleanups
  + We specify browser.cache.memory.enable under disk avoidance. That's
    wrong. We don't even set it at all. Torbutton relic?
  + Disk leak documentation
  - Firefox 17 will mess up all patch links
 
- Heavy Writing by section
  + Intro:
    + We target Firefox ESR
  - Adversary Goals
    - Describe how each adversary attack violates design goals
    - "Correlate activity across multiple site visits" as one of the adversary
      goals. This is the primary goal of the ad networks, though. We need to
      explicitly mention it in the Adversary Goals section for completeness.
  - Misc implementation
    - document the environment variables and settings used to provide a non-grey "New Identity" button.
    - Link to prefs.js
    - Mockup privacy UI
  - Identifier Linkability 
    - 3.5.8 is not clear that what we're trying to limit is non-click
      driven/non-interactive linkability rather than linkability in all cases.
      Other sections may have this problem, too.
      - This is a subtlety that arises from both the impossibility of satisfying
        unlinkability due to covert channels in GET/POST, as well as the desire
        to avoid breaking thinks like consensual federated login.
    - He reminded me about documenting disabling IndexedDB, but that is just one
      of the many prefs.js changes we need to document.
    - We should only preserve window.name if the url bar domain remains the
      same. I could be convinced of this, but it's going to be trickier to
      implement and I think it's not really possible to remove linkability for user
      clicks in general.
  - Fingerprinting
    - describe our resolution defenses
    - Explain why panopticlick is weirdsauce
    - provide an entropy count estimate for fingerprinting defenses
    - We should perhaps be more vocal about the fingerprinting issues with
      some or all of  http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/. I think I agree.
