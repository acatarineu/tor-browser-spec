Rolling Back Tor Browser Updates
================================

In some cases a critical issue is found shortly after releasing an update.
In those cases rolling back an update to avoid having more users hitting
the issue can be useful.

There are two separate cases:
 - rolling back an update for users of all platforms
 - rolling back an update only for users of a specific platform

Note: this is about rolling back updates for stable/alpha releases.
Rolling back updates on nightly is more difficult.

In the following instructions we are assuming that we are rolling back
an alpha update. But the same instructions should work for a stable
release too by replacing all instances of "alpha" by "release".
We also assume that we released version 9.5a11 and want to roll back to
version 9.5a10. You will need to replace those versions numbers in the
instructions.

If you followed the instructions from ReleaseProcess, in the directory
/srv/aus1-master.torproject.org/htdocs/torbrowser/update_3 on staticiforme
you should have renamed the directory alpha to alpha.old.
If you didn't do it, you should get a new copy of the update_responses
directory for the previous release, for instance by running
"make update_responses-alpha" in tor-browser-build, after
checking out the tag from the previous release.

You should also check that the previous release is still present in
the directory /srv/cdn-master.torproject.org/htdocs/aus1/torbrowser.


Rolling back an update for users of all platforms
-------------------------------------------------

You can roll back the update with the following steps on staticiforme:

 - in /srv/aus1-master.torproject.org/htdocs/torbrowser/update_3, remove
   the directory "alpha" and rename "alpha.old" to "alpha".

 - edit the file "alpha/.htaccess" and at the top, after the line
   "RewriteEngine On" add a new line:
      RewriteRule ^[^/]+/9.5a11/ no-update.xml [last]
   With this line we can avoid proposing an update to the previous
   version to the users who already updated to the new version.

 - run "static-update-component aus1.torproject.org"


Rolling back an update only for users of a specific platform
------------------------------------------------------------

In the following instructions, we assume that we want to roll back the
update for users of Windows x86_64 only. In the following instructions,
you should replace WINNT_x86_64-gcc3-x64 with the platform for which
you want to roll back the update (see build_targets in the file
projects/release/update_responses_config.yml in tor-browser-build for
the list of platforms).

You can roll back the update with the following steps on staticiforme:

 - in /srv/aus1-master.torproject.org/htdocs/torbrowser/update_3, rename
   or copy the directory "alpha.old" to "alpha.9.5a10".

 - edit the file "alpha/.htaccess" and at the top, after the line
   "RewriteEngine On" add a new line:
      RewriteRule ^WINNT_x86_64-gcc3-x64/.* https://aus1.torproject.org/torbrowser/update_3/alpha.95a10/$0 [last]

 - run "static-update-component aus1.torproject.org"
