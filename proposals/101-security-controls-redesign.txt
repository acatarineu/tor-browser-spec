1 Introduction

  Tor Browser is well-known for its defenses against web tracking and
  fingerprinting. However, providing Tor users just a privacy-enhanced
  browser is often not enough to safeguard against deanonymization
  attacks as those protections might simply get bypassed by exploiting
  browser vulnerabilities. Tor Browser therefore offers several security
  enhancements as well to reduce that risk. Most of those features are
  provided by extensions which Tor Browser includes, namely Torbutton,
  NoScript, and HTTPS Everywhere.

1.1 Motivation

  By default Torbutton, NoScript, and HTTPS Everywhere are visible on
  the toolbar in Tor Browser and there is no hint about possible
  security enhancements, with the exception of a notification bar shown
  on first start and pointing to our security slider. This has a number
  of suboptimal outcomes which this proposal seeks to address:

  a) Security controls are scattered over and within different
     extensions. That makes it hard to understand which knobs a user
     could turn to improve their security settings while not being
     exposed to additional fingerprinting risks.
  b) The toolbar gets cluttered with three additional icons that provide
     access to both per-site and global security settings. This is
     confusing to users. Part of the confusion stems from mixing
     non-global with global security controls on the toolbar not
     indicating which of them just affect a particular website while
     others affect the whole browser session. Another part is that users
     feel the need to navigate through different levels of extension
     menus to make basic adjustments to their security level.
  c) There is the security vs. usability trade-off and little incentives
     to change the default which comes with Tor Browser. That results in
     users just staying on the lowest security level while at least some
     of them could get convinced to raise that level if we managed to
     provide an improved experience around our security controls, both
     functionality- and UX-wise.

1.2 The State of the Security Controls

  That is how the toolbar in Tor Browser looks like currently:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  |  ---  ---  -------------------------   ---------------   ---  ---  |
  |  |N|  |T|  | URL bar               |   | Search bar  |   |H|  |M|  |
  |  ---  ---  -------------------------   ---------------   ---  ---  |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  N = NoScript button
  T = Torbutton button
  H = HTTPS Everywhere button
  M = (Hamburger) Menu button

  We include HTTPS Everywhere to help against potential Tor Exit node
  eavesdroppers and active attackers. To provide users with optional
  defense-in-depth against JavaScript and other potential exploit
  vectors, we use NoScript modifying some of its defaults[1]. Torbutton
  includes the security slider which is meant to give users an easy way
  to adjust their security level from Standard to Safest, depending on
  their perceived needs.

2 Proposal

  Generally, items on the toolbar serve two important purposes: they are
  shortcuts to features often used and they inform about current state.
  With that in mind we can think about redoing our toolbar helping that
  way with issues outlined in 1.1 a) and b). The remaining problems
  (part of 1.1 b) and 1.1 c)) will be addressed in section 2.2, 3.3, and
  follow-up proposals.

2.1 Restructuring the Toolbar

2.1.1 Removing HTTPS Everywhere and NoScript from the Toolbar

  I'd propose we remove both NoScript and HTTPS Everywhere from the
  toolbar and leave Torbutton on it for now:

  Torbutton serves a number of purposes and access to security settings
  is just one of them. Moreover, we are in the process of restructuring
  at least part of its functionality right now[2] and more will likely
  happen in the future in this area. We can think about whether
  Torbutton should remain on the toolbar after that transition is done.

  HTTPS Everywhere has the option to block all unencrypted requests and
  apart from that is just enforcing HTTPS connections according to the
  rulesets it ships, which is our default. There is not much gain
  security-wise leaving it on the toolbar and users might just be
  confused by the "Block all unencrypted requests" option. I'd argue as
  well that the status indicator is not important enough to justify
  precious space on the toolbar either.

  NoScript comes with a myriad of configuration options. We try to
  abstract that away by shipping a list of defaults for Tor Browser[1].
  But still having NoScript easily accessible makes it dangerous to
  choose the wrong option, especially as the majority of its
  functionality does not need to be exposed for Tor Browser users.
  Moreover, the scary warning icon which is visible when NoScript
  allows JavaScript is highly confusing to users as we ship this
  configuration as our default. Removing the icon from the toolbar
  should solve those two problems. We might want to think about exposing
  the small amount of functionality which especially users with the
  security slider set to "Safest" might need: managing finer-grained
  script control. See section 2.2 for that.

2.1.2 Showing Security Slider State

  We essentially have one tool we want to promote to deal with security
  settings: the security slider. Keeping in mind that icons on the
  toolbar serve as well the purpose of showing state of important
  settings, we could think about providing an own toolbar button for the
  security slider. We could use an icon similar to the one suggested by
  ninavizz[3] or come up with a different solution.

  However, being able to easily adjust the slider level is risky as it
  affects all the tabs and windows in a session. It might lead to
  confusion as to whether the settings are applied globally or just for
  a tab in question, which is error-prone. To mitigate that problem we
  could at least warn users about the possible danger and provide the
  option to acquire a New Identity right after changing the security
  slider level. Doing so is a good idea anyway, but might not be enough
  to justify exposing security slider functionality on the toolbar.

  We'll add a security settings button to the toolbar which shows the
  current slider state but, once clicked on, opens an about:preferences
  pane in a new tab which contains the security slider. That way we
  make the current slider state easily visible while avoiding the risk
  of accidentally changing it. Moreover, having it as an option on
  Firefox's preferences pane reinforces the idea of slider settings
  being applied to the whole session and not just to a particular tab or
  window.

2.1.3 Reorganizing the Toolbar

  Taking the preceding chapters into account this leaves us with two
  toolbar buttons for the Tor Browser toolbar: the one from the
  Torbutton extension and the button for the security settings.
  Following the toolbar layout of Firefox we should move both buttons to
  the right, between the search bar and the menu button.

  Now, the new toolbar would look like:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  |  --------------------------------   --------------  ---  ---  ---  |
  |  | URL bar                      |   | Search bar |  |T|  |S|  |M|  |
  |  --------------------------------   --------------  ---  ---  ---  |
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  T = Torbutton button
  S = Security Settings button
  M = (Hamburger) Menu button

  Note: The reorganized toolbar has the additional benefit that no
  per-site state is shown anymore on it, which should lead to less
  confusion about whether the settings visible there apply globally or
  not.

2.2 Dealing with Per-Site Security Settings

  There are a number of features disabled on higher security settings as
  they are potentially dangerous, yet sometimes users need or want to
  allow them anyway. So far, these options were exposed by click-to-play
  buttons or directly in the NoScript user interface accessible over the
  toolbar button.

  With NoScript gone from the toolbar the click-to-play options remain,
  but easily allowing JavaScript per site and making the status of
  NoScript related settings visible is not available anymore. To solve
  this I'd propose to follow the path we are currently taking with our
  circuit display redesign[2]: we are moving site specific settings into
  the URL bar.

  One way to do that would be to use the Permissions section which opens
  after clicking on the "i" icon in the URL bar. However, while showing
  the security permissions the user has granted there (too) is a good
  idea, it does not solve the problem of easily allowing e.g. JavaScript
  on a website, and seeing its status without the need to click on any
  button. We could have small icons on the right side of the URL bar
  accomplishing that, though. That way, users could easily see if they
  had JavaScript, or WebGL, or ... enabled on that particular website in
  case they are on higher security levels. Moreover, they would be able
  to adjust those permissions quickly without the need to deal with any
  NoScript user interface or additional menus just by toggling those
  icons.

  By default only the option to temporarily allow JavaScript would be
  visible. All the click-to-play features could show up once there is a
  respective object embedded on a website. We should refrain from
  exposing icons for every single "active content" in the URL bar,
  though. Rather, besides the button for temporarily allowing JavaScript
  we would only add one additionally, which is responsible for
  manipulating and showing the state of "active content" (like WebGL,
  SVG, fonts etc.).

3 Additional Considerations

3.1 Where Are My Extensions Gone?

  Some users might be confused and think NoScript and HTTPS Everywhere
  are gone now, plus they want to have their "old" way of setting their
  per-site settings back. That's okay and they can easily add NoScript
  and HTTPS Everywhere back to their toolbar if they wish. It would be
  good to point this out in the transition phase to the new interface at
  least.

3.2 How Do We Inform Users about the New Interface?

  I don't know yet how we ideally inform users about the new interface.
  That is not part of this proposal but might merit an own one.

3.3 Should We Change the Default Security Level?

  As much as I wished to change the default security level, to e.g.
  "Safer", right now I think we are not there yet. Part of the security
  control redesign should be fixing bugs that make the current and new
  interface less effective and painful to use[4][5][6][7]. We could
  revisit that discussion, though, once we have solved the low hanging
  bugs.
